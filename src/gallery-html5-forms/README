HTML5 Forms for YUI 3, by Matt Snider (http://github.com/mattsnider/)

I. Changelog

11.11.2010 - Initial upload


II. Roadmap

* more support for new html5 input types (currently only `email` and `url` are validated (possible optional UI components as well)
* allow developers to specify which features to use
* allow developers to override html5 default behavior for some features
* event delegation for blur and focus, so we don't have to attach to each input

III. Notes

To use:

oForm = new Y.HTML5_form_support({boundingBox: 'pathToYourForm'});
oForm.render();

New Attributes:

aftervalidationfx - a function that will be called after any field is blurred and validated; for HTML 5 enabled browsers this will use the ':invalid' and ':valid' psedo classes to determine validity
btnsubmit - CSS path to the submit button; if defined, the submit button will become disabled when a form field is invalid
supported - public variable to indicate if the system delegated to HTML 5; only written once
